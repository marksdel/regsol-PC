				<h3 class="text-left">Instructor-led</h3>
				Our scheduled training is designed to take place at the times/dates set out in our <a href="public-training-schedule.php">training timetable</a>. Focusing on those topics that require more in-depth discussion, we have a range of half and full day courses hosted at different locations throughout the year. Attendees have a choice of either attending in-person at one of our training facilities, or online via a live-stream webinar . In both cases, these instructor-led sessions help attendees to focus on the content and ask questions interactively as it is being delivered.
